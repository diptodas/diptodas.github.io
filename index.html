                  I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in the <a href="https://web.cs.toronto.edu" target="_blank">Department of Computer Science</a> and the <a href="https://ischool.utoronto.ca/" target="_blank">Faculty of Information</a> at the <a href="https://www.utoronto.ca/" target="_blank">University of Toronto</a>, where I work with <a href="https://www.ishtiaque.net/" target="_blank">Syed Ishtiaque Ahmed</a> and <a href="https://shionguha.ca/" target="_blank">Shion Guha</a>.

                  
                  My research in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) examines how sociotechnical systems can be designed and governed to foster greater equity and fairness for underrepresented cultural communities. In this space, I investigate how fairness in algorithmic systems' downstream applications is conceptualized and negotiated, particularly in the governance of online platforms within culturally diverse communities. I take a community-centered research approach that integrates in-depth formative studies (e.g., contextual interviews, trace ethnography) with large-scale quantitative analyses (e.g., algorithmic audits, text mining), alongside iterative system building and evaluation. Some examples of my recent work include algorithmic audits that expose colonial epistemic hierarchies in language models, community-centered studies of content creators, moderators, and other users navigating ethical challenges shaped by religious values and national identities, and co-design efforts that develop tools for inter-community ethical deliberation. Drawing on sociotechnical systems studies, I critically examine the role of technology in reshaping sociopolitical dynamics in culturally diverse communities, reconceptualizing fairness across race, gender, ethnicity, religion, caste, nationality, linguistic practices, and immigration status. More recently, my research has expanded beyond online platforms to explore the fairness of algorithmic systems in higher education, public service, and gig work.
                  
                  
                  




                  <!-- My research in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) focuses on how biases in sociotechnical systems--particularly in language technologies and platform governance--emerge not just as technical limitations but as manifestations of epistemic injustice.

                  In this space, I have investigated how fairness is conceptualized and negotiated in the contexts of <a href="files/papers/CSCW21_governance.pdf" target="_blank">platform governance</a>, <a href="files/papers/CHI24_audit.pdf" target="_blank">language technologies</a>, <a href="files/papers/JCSCW25_gig.pdf" target="_blank">gig work</a>, and <a href="files/papers/CHI25_homelessness.pdf" target="_blank">public service</a> in cross-cultural contexts.

                  I draw on sociotechnical systems studies literature to critically interrogate what roles technologies play in reshaping social and politcal dynamics and reconceptualizes societal understanding of fairness in culturally-diverse communities.

                  More recently, our group has started exploring accessibility of generative AI for blind and low vision people, such as their <a href="files/papers/BLV_GenAI_ASSETS24.pdf" target="_blank">use contexts and mental models of GenAI tools</a> and <a href="files/papers/alt-prompt-CHI24.pdf" target="_blank">alt text for AI-generated images</a>. -->

Yet, we know little about how ability-diverse teams, such as those involving people with and without vision impairments, make use of collaborative writing tools.  -->
                    <!-- In this project, we investigate how people with vision impairments interact with collaborative writing tools (e.g., Microsoft Word, Google Docs) to produce shared documents with their sighted collaborators, the challenges they face in developing collaboration awareness (i.e., understanding who commented or edited what and where in the document), and how they develop shared norms and workarounds to adapt to the complexities of collaborative features. Our work also uncovers how accessibility in collaborative work is shaped by interpersonal relations, power dynamics, and organizational ableism. Building on the insights gathered from interviews and observations with blind writers, we build and evaluate new auditory techniques to support accessible collaborative writing in both asynchronous and synchronous settings.

				        	   In recent times, maker culture has garnered much interest due to its potential in democratizing technological practices and recognizing people with disabilities as co-designers— not just as passive users and recipients of support. Still, we know little about collaborative making within ability-diverse teams and how accessible maker communities are created and sustained through social structures and institutions (e.g., through "care work"). To address these questions,  -->
                    <!-- In this project, we investigate the situated practice of collaborative making at a community weaving studio where blind weavers and their sighted instructors collaboratively produce handwoven products using physical materials such as loom, shuttle, and yarns. Through ethnographic field observations and contextual interviews, we uncover how blind weavers engage in coordinated embodied interaction with their sighted instructors and the materials in their workspace to learn and perform weaving steps. Building on these insights, we design interactive technologies to augment blind weavers' embodied understanding of the weaving process and the state of the woven products and interrogate the role of digital technologies in traditional, manual form of making.

			                Working from home became a mainstream work practice in many organizations during the COVID-19 pandemic. While remote work has received much scholarly and public attention over the years, we still know little about how people with disabilities engage in remote work from their homes and what access means in this context.  

                      This project focuses on understanding and rethinking accessibility in remote work. Through interviews with neurodivergent professionals who have Autism Spectrum Disorder, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, learning disabilities, and psychosocial disabilities (e.g., anxiety, depression), we found that

			                Peer-production communities like Wikipedia and OpenStreetMap have become important sources of high quality content that serve billions of human information needs and provide essential world knowledge to artificial intelligence systems. However, these peer-production communities are alleged to have participation disparities, with men significantly outnumbering women. Focusing on OpenStreetMap, this project investigates the relationship between gender participation disparities and content disparities. We are particularly interested in assessing whether men and women contribute diferently, and — to the extent that we see evidence of this — examining whether <em> self-focus bias </em> plays a role in governing the relationship between the two.

We proved the practicality of our system via extensive experiments using real human genome datasets.

            		I love music. Singing, for me, has always been a blissful escape, a way to unwind. Coming from a music-loving family, my journey with singing started at an early age. I mostly cover Bangla songs. During my undergrad years, I performed in several events as a member of Murchhona, the central cultural club of BUET. After moving to the USA, I performed in a number of student organized events in Indianapolis and Chicago. You can check out my Youtube and Soundcloud profiles below.

            		My travel enthusiast soul always wants to <em>go places</em> (in its literal sense). I love to spend my free time planning the itinerary of my umpteenth future trip, and whenever I can carve out a few days off my busy schedule (and the world is not going through a pandemic-induced lockdown), I put on my traveler’s hat and check destinations off my lengthy bucket list. My travels have taken me to mountaintops that reach the clouds, awe-inspiring glaciers, torquoise lakes, thundering waterfalls, and pristine beaches. You can find some photos captured by my partner during our <a href="https://abirsaha.com/photos/" target="_blank">travels</a>.
